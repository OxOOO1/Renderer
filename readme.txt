After truncating and redesigning larger portion of the code, the application ended up being simple 3D parser-renderer. 
Rendering class is handling low-level rendering (device and context);
Painter class does the Drawing;
Scene class owns all objects that are to be drawn (which are imported in Scene's constructor);
App was build and tested in VisualStudio2017
Thank you!
